<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello All! My name is Brandon Kue. At the moment, I am a 4th year college student at Sac State University.</p>

<p>I decided that it would be a good idea to learn how to web develop so I can learn how to make other projects. Doing so will teach me a wide array of skills that wil definitely benefit me in my future career.</p>
